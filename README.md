Abstract

Post-conflict recovery is critically important for restoring stability, rebuilding institutions, and preventing renewed violence in war-torn regions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers significant potential to support this process through applications in humanitarian assistance, infrastructure restoration, and civil governance.
However, while AI has been widely used to enhance combat operations, its role in post-conflict contexts remains underexplored. Research has largely overlooked how AI can support peacebuilding, justice, and reconstruction, resulting in a lack of guidance.
To address this gap, we make three contributions. First, we propose a taxonomy of post-conflict problems, describing key characteristics of war and their impacts. Second, we develop a tool that, given post-conflict problems as input, generates prompts for large language models to explore AI-based solutions—outlining benefits, risks, and mitigations—and compiles them into impact assessment cards. Finally, we evaluate whether the tool can support decision-making for AI post-war solutions through a two-step study: in the first step, participants choose and critique AI solutions independently; in the second, they do so with the support of the impact assessment cards. We compare their responses to assess the tool’s effect on structured decision-making.
